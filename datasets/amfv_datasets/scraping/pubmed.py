"""Scrape PubMed clinical practice guidelines into normalized markdown documents.

PubMed indexes roughly 43k articles tagged with the `Guideline` publication
type, but most of them expose an abstract only and stay under publisher
copyright. This module deliberately scrapes the intersection with the PMC Open
Access subset instead:

    Guideline[pt] AND pubmed pmc open access[filter] AND English[la]

That is about 3,000 guidelines, growing by a handful a week, and it is the only
slice where the full text is both retrievable and openly licensed.

Licensing is recorded per document rather than claimed for the source, because
the Open Access Subset is not uniformly Creative Commons licensed. Censused
over all 2,999 records present on 2026-07-29: CC BY 44.5%, CC BY-NC 22.1%,
CC BY-NC-ND 18.4%, CC BY-NC-SA 2.1%, CC0 1.3%, and 11.7% carrying publisher
terms instead. By what that permits, 45.8% is unrestricted for derivative
works, 24.1% is non-commercial only, 18.4% asserts NoDerivatives, and 11.7%
has to be read case by case.

Discovery and extraction both go through NCBI's E-utilities rather than the
rendered pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov pages. `esearch` paginates by numeric offset and
reports the result total, `esummary` resolves a whole batch of PMIDs to PMCIDs
and citation metadata in one request, and `efetch` returns JATS XML carrying the
article body, section structure and license. All three are documented, versioned
contracts that do not break when the website is restyled.

Attribution:
Meditron's guideline scrapers (epfLLM/meditron, gap-replay/guidelines) cover a
dozen sources but have no PubMed scraper, so this module has no upstream port to
follow. It follows the conventions of `nice.py` in this package instead.
